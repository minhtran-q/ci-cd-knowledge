  <br/>

  + **Workflow:** A workflow is a configurable automated process that consists of one or more jobs.
  + **Events:** Events are specific activities in a repository that trigger workflows.
  + **Step:** Steps are individual tasks within a job. They can run commands or actions (reusable extensions).
  + **Actions:** Actions are reusable units of code that perform specific tasks. They can be used within steps to simplify workflows.
  + **Jobs:** A job is a set of steps that run as part of your workflow. Recall that a step can run a task, a command, or an action.
  + **Runner:** A runner is a machine, either hosted by GitHub or self-hosted, that executes the jobs in a workflow.

### Using Github Actions

<details>
  <summary>Managing Secrets</summary>
  <br/>
  
  **Manage:**
  
  1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
  2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
  3. In the left sidebar, click on **Secrets and variables > Actions**.
  4. Click on **New repository secret**.
  5. Add a name for your secret and its value, then click Add secret.

  **Use:**

  To use a secret in your workflow, reference it in your YAML file like this:
  ```
  jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Use secret
      run: echo ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
  ```

  _Note:_ Always use secrets for sensitive information like API keys, tokens, and passwords.

  <summary>Managing Environment Variables</summary>
  <br/>

  **Environment-Specific Variables:** Navigate to **Settings > Environments**, create an environment.
  **Environment Variables in Workflow:** You can define environment variables directly in your workflow file.

  ```
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      env:
        MY_VARIABLE: 'value'
      steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
  
      - name: Use environment variable
        run: echo $MY_VARIABLE
  ```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Caching</summary>
  <br/>

  Caching in GitHub Actions is a mechanism that allows you to store and reuse files or data between workflow runs.

  1. **Cache Creation:** During a workflow run, you can create a cache by specifying a unique key. This key is used to identify the cache.
  2. **Cache Storage:** The cache is stored on GitHubâ€™s servers.
  3. **Cache Restoration:** In subsequent workflow runs, the cache can be restored using the same key, allowing you to reuse the stored data.

  ```
  name: Java CI

  on: [push, pull_request]
  
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  
      - name: Cache Maven dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.m2/repository
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-maven-
  ```
  _The actions/cache@v3 action caches the Maven dependencies located in the ~/.m2/repository directory._

  <summary>Security for CI/CD pipeline</summary>
  <br/>
  
  + Store sensitive information like API keys, tokens, and passwords in GitHub Secrets.
  + Integrate security tools like CodeQL, Snyk, or Gitleaks to automatically scan your code for vulnerabilities.
